Due to Birmingham City Council being bankrupt I am seeing huge changes in services and a massive reduction in the support offered to homeless people as well as preventing people becoming homeless. In this surreal digital collage, hands are dangling or holding homes just out of reach of the people who need them. I have added a helter-skelter ride. The ride represents the confusion and disorder that people in need face, daily. The long wait to access small amounts of affordable social housing is depressing and an obstacle to thriving. People become obsessed with finding accommodation, hence several figures having houses as heads. In this piece I am referencing Gee Vauchers's Feeding Of The Five Thousand artwork for the anarcho punk band, Crass. I wanted to recreate a snapshot of a corrupted space and system that breeds conflict. This is a very personal response to the situation homeless people deal with on a daily basis, a reaction to the housing crisis in the UK in general and how, as someone who has been working to alleviate this problem for over a decade, I feel the situation is becoming increasingly desperate.",

For over a decade I have been supporting people to get out of homelessness and to find a home they can call their own. Having no home, no shelter is devestating and creates a level of trauma and disconnection from the rest of society. Housing is such a basic need and for many it is elusive. The hands holding the houses represents how out of reach affordable housing is. The helter-skelter ride shows people going round and round in the system only to be spat out at the bottom and left to start all over again. My work references Gee Vaucher's artwork\n\nFeeding Of The 5000 for the anarcho punk band, Crass.

I had to overcome multiple severe barriers to get there. I did it and in my last year I won a travel award. I got on a ship and sailed to New York, to draw the inhabitants of the ship. However, at the time, as now, migrants were also on the seas, trying to find a better life. The sharp contrast in circumstance, between those that had good fortune to be born in a wealthier country and those born in a poor country, haunted me as I sailed across the seas. I wondered about our collective humanity as we sailed. I kept dreaming of dinghies bobbing along the side of the large ship. None ever turned up. A sad journey for all.",

The textured backgrounds to these images are close up photographs I took around the house of things ranging from dirty stove tops to leftover sourdough bread brought home from my housemate's job on Sundays.\n\n\n\nFriend Society (the yellow B5 zine) includes a series of vignettes in a variety of formats including comics, lists, photography and found text collaged together to build a clearer picture about the possibilities of a large group of strangers learning to live together and the downfalls of property guardianship.\n\n\n\n35-36 Egremont Place (the white A6 zine) quotes minutes from a meeting of the Brighton Council to discuss the planning application for Pilgrims Home (the location of the property guardianship). These quotes are contrasted with illustrated photographs from my experience of the space, the trees, the \"empty\" building they discussed as 35 people were actively and legally living there.\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of the Shelter exhibition, these 3 zines would be housed in a custom A4 folder.",

There has been a lot of speculation about why they were made, especially by male historians, which reflects our continued misunderstanding around birthing, sick and recovering bodies.\n\n\n\nThis Sheela births a digital native, hanging from them via an umbilical cord.\n\n\n\nBirthing bodies are the first shelter we enter when we come into physical existence in this world. They should be the safest place to be but structural oppression and inequality disturbs the most ancient shelter we have, the womb. Our desire of shelter as we continue to grow into adulthood will always be rooted in our experience of the original shelter of the womb and will imprint on our lives forever.

To bridge the gap between ancient and modern methods, I incorporated cement and clay into the daub mixture, which represents contemporary building practices using mortar and brickwork.\n\nThe sculpture itself is a pair of hands forming an ancient mud hut-style structure, symbolizing human capacity to shape our environment and create shelter from materials provided by nature.

    "Content": "This piece of work is based on the right of the displaced to have the right to shelter when in a conflict zone. Shelter is a primal necessity for survival and when removed incumbents become vulnerable to domicide, discrimination, physical and mental health and health inequalities, access to safe food , security and become subject to inhumane treatment and violence. The word shelter denotes a temporary situation but for the displaced,it can last days ,weeks or years,and can include intergenerational post traumatic and imposed colonial trauma. The shelter they do find often puts them in extremely vulnerable situations ,and they are often situated close to combat zones.\n\nIn my own family displacement happened due to war and interment in concentration camps or work camps during times of severe economic decline. This experience created reliquaries of stories and objects such as a sunflowers seeds in a pocket of a political prisoner camp survivor, keys to a home, or earth from a homeland to be placed in a burial plot of a displaced person. These are passed down through the generations\n\nI have used text, muted palate, found objects, soft sculpture and patchwork to explore the themes of protection, gesture , smell, when making the armaments and explore the idea of longing to return from situations of displacement. Referencing and juxtaposing textile traditions and motif from traditional British textiles to Afghan war rugs. Creating an edginess between the visual floral motif and the landscape of the conflict zone.Mickey mouse peers from under the handkerchief in the left hand corner chatting with the wagging dog!\n\nThe central text in black felt references the idiom �Home Sweet Home� and is a phrase that originated from a popular song in 1823.It references the pleasures of returning home ,and signifies it as the centre of stability and comfort in a family and community life. The text is placed on a patchwork background of handkerchiefs dating back a 100 years. Delicate in the nature, lace edged , stained with lip stick and spots of blood, signifying the distress of displacement and acting as a vessel for the collection of tears from the trauma of being forced into temporary shelter. Held in the cloth are microscopic structures of dried tears ,emotions and natural pain killers released when the body is under stress.\n\nMy soft sculpture armaments include drones, hand grenades, tanks and guns. They challenge the sanctity of the Home Sweet Home in their position in the composition. They are designed and made of furnishings,children's clothes,and cloth that references the global origins of the 120 million people across all continents who seek shelter due to war. They are the fragments of cloth found and scavenged in conflict zones where domicide has destroyed homes and community infrastructure. Being used , as currency ,to wear, ,shrouds for the dead , built into shelters or burnt for heat by the displaced. The soft sculpture hands use symbolic , gesture, to represent the displaced seeking shelter. The hands are held up in symbol of surrender / peace, to signify the protected right civilians should have. Their fingers are covered in cloth from around the world. The wrists wear protective charm bracelets or an eye with found objects such as keys,a shooting star, dice, four leaf clover, suitcase, St Christopher, good luck coin, boot, seed from a concentration camp, vial of soil from homeland, a wishing bone, cross, a chimney sweep, a lottery ticket, a rainbow, a Hamsa hand, a sixpence, a fairy, peace sign, and a horse shoe. Symbolising the element of chance and luck in the safety of the displaced when they leave on an unknown journey.\n\nAll of the sculptures and frame are stuffed with dried lavender heads,the piece has a multi sensory scenographic presence in the gallery. It is visual, tactile and has scent from the stuffed lavender armaments and hands. This allows a move away from the traditional visual appreciation of the work ,where the art work enters to body to evoke an olfactory response to memory ,nostalgia and homeliness that the displaced hold in their memories and oral histories. This references the new use of systems such as Lavender AI technology that processes data taken from data bases, social media and surveillance to determine targets such as buildings , and people. This greatly expands the bombing capabilities, increases civilian casualties and collateral damage .It is a primary driver of domicide when used in urban war zones where many civilian and infrastructure targets are destroyed. It is a example of a human machine interface that takes the decision making out of target identification.",

    "Content": "LOVE, THE BLACK TYPE, Hope River, 2024, acrylic on paper, 42 x 29.7\n\n\n\nThis painting is part of a series inspired by the following short story by Hope River.\n\n\n\nIt�s 4OO hours and snowing somewhere in Oklahoma.\n\n\n\nA petrol station is the only glow against a backdrop void of the five senses. The peace is unsettling. It feels like we�re at Legba�s crossroads, staring into the past, present, and future simultaneously. But this shrine-like petrol station, with its sickly-sweet fa�ade, fluorescent light buzz, and air of otherworldly worship, makes the prospect of stepping into the void, ok-ish.\n\n\n\nTwo strangers search for their seats on a Greyhound chariot parked out front, it�s passing into the void, into everywhere but nowhere. Checking seat numbers against the ones blazing on their phones every step, they slumber through the aisle. Sleepiness and vigilance, traits inherent to both. He�s in 20a, she�s 20b. Two black seats right at the back. Really, is race still a thing in the afterlife or just a home comfort during your transition? For some reason, rows 17, 18 and 19 are missing. The two share a look that says, �just keep movin�, we know this shit already, it, it don�t matter.� After a couple of rough starts - something to do with a wrong soul count - the chariot makes it tracks.\n\n\n\nA lot is going on. Cotton shaped weed clouds fill the air, we hope Snoop is here to lighten the mood. The driver loses his nut, screaming federal laws as if it matters where we�re going � he still thinks we�re down there, bless him. Kids cry, pissed their routines have been fucked up because of an 8-hour delay. A broken toilet door hits and whips, fanning shit directly across 20a and b.\n\n\n\nWho are these strangers? Well, he�s got swag, the geeky Kendrick kind. With chocolate skin, a slim build, and wired glasses, he sits at the edge of sensibility. Wearing a checked mantle, silky trackies, and a balaclava, the portal to his soul lies in his eyes and 4c Nappy crown. She�s bonnie, the Lianne kind. With honey skin, a slender Rwandan physique, and foresight, she sits in sensibility. Wearing a knitted shawl, smudged jeans, and her 3b crown in a knot, her smile is the portal to her soul.\n\n\n\nThey share a sense of familiarity, though they�ve never crossed paths � so they think. They speak in gestures alone, use a code pre-written in their African ancestry. He passes her his Taco Bell wrapper to bin. Whilst she bins it, she passes him her half-eaten Subway. With bloodshot eyes he watches a strange ass cartoon on his phone, it makes him belly laugh. Though annoyed by the fact he isn�t wearing headphones, she�s just happy he�s found joy. He sees her trying to sleep, so he puts his phone to sleep. They share a final look that says, �sweet dreams.�\n\n\n\nEventually, they surrender to a comfortable rest. Unapologetically nestled into each other. Legs entwined, jackets turned blankets shared; shelter. Two strangers, at the end of this life, anyway, entering one dream of no return.\n\n\n\nIt�s 400 years ago and snowing everywhere, but nowhere.\n\n\n\nDazed, they wake up. They consider trying to stand on their feet, but staying still seems like an omen of the lasting peace to come.\n\n\n\nA white candle is the only glow against a blood painted and sugar flavoured sky. Legba�s shadow enters and leaves its glow. Now, as Mr and Mrs, they still commune in gestures, this time as a strong embrace. Their time is nigh, but �it, it don�t matter.� They�re forever too starved to eat, too speechless to talk, too tired to sleep, too dead to live. When the light dies, and the white wax sets all, that is when their promise of freedom will come to be. That is when the void will envelope their being, but never destroy their shelter: their love for one another.\n\n\n\n-",

They can be empty or full, waiting to receive or holding intangible concepts like knowledge, feelings or memories. Honestly the viewer brings their own perspective to them. The figure is also slightly mysterious. Is it a feminine form? Is she pregnant? What does she suggest to the viewer? Could she also be a vessel? A vessel for knowledge or fruitfulness perhaps?

Humans are innately driven to recreate such havens, from the womb to the spaces we build in adulthood.\n\n\n\nThis connects to the theme of shelter in a world where safety feels progressively fragile. Shelter can signify a structure, a refuge, or the act of offering protection. It embodies safety, belonging, and sanctuary�core human needs.\n\n\n\nA fleeing mother seeking safety for her children reflects the universal quest for shelter, echoing the primal haven of the womb. This painting explores fragility, resilience, and the enduring human desire for security amidst uncertainty.",

After several days of conscientiously observing these birds, I felt a sense of dissonance between their calmness and my inner emptiness, because they have a home and I don't. I don't have it because it was taken away (I'm talking about Luhansk, occupied in 2014). They, in their close attachment to the place, seemed integral, inextricably linked to the space that surrounded them.\n\n\n\nI was deprived of my home. Now I am looking for a new one. But the feeling that I am in my place is not there, no matter how much I search. Is it even possible to find another home? And if it is, will my old wound ever heal?\n\n\n\nThe act of swallowing swans becomes a metaphor for this desire to find a home. Envy of the swans, who have what I lack, makes me want to eat them.

Through the image of a self-portrait consuming swans, I depict my longing to find what I lack � a home, a familiar place, which I was deprived of in childhood due to the Russian occupation. The swans symbolize attachment to a place, idyll, and belonging, all of which I have lost. By consuming them, I try to understand how to find a new home, and ultimately realize that, even without a physical home, I myself become a shelter � the swans have settled within me.",

    "Content": "Greg�s Hut and Other Stories (2024) submission for the Outside In National exhibition open call �Shelter�.\n\nMixed media painted collage with vintage ephemera. Comprising a panel piece 27.94 x 35.56 and two miniature paintings set within a book cover frame 19 x 12.7. Miniature painting sizes: 7 x 7, 9.5 x 6.3. Framed in a shadow box frame 62 x 44.5.\n\nVideo https://vimeo.com/1034750287/f6212bcae6\n\nResponding to the theme of Shelter, I initially wanted to create an artwork about Greg�s Hut bothy on the Pennine Way trail. It is the highest bothy in England. Greg�s Hut was named in memory of mountaineer John Gregory who died in a climbing accident in the Alps in 1968. It is a humble two roomed stone cottage located on Cross Fell in the Northern Pennines. Greg�s Hut was originally built as a blacksmith�s and to house miners working in the lead mines on the local hills in the 1800s.\n\nThese days it is used by local shepherds and is a welcome sight and place of shelter for those who hike this 268 mile route, as this entry into the Bothy book from 2006 illustrates;\n\n�13th -14th Jan. I have never been so grateful for a hut in the middle of nowhere, leaning 45 degrees in order to stay upright, pelting hail and sleet and 90 mph winds.�\n\n(Extract from MBA Newsletter no.207, Summer 2007 by Greg�s Hut Association secretary Val Harrison)\n\nThe Pennine Way was the first national trail in England, allowing public access to the countryside. All thanks to decades of campaigning led by activist and journalist Tom Stephenson. 2025 will mark 60 years since that fight was won and the trail first opened. With this in mind I felt it was important to develop my idea for this project to include other landmarks and stories about this significant trail and the stunning landscape it traverses.\n\nThis mixed media work features a variety of landmarks on the trail including Greg�s Hut, various cairns that mark the path and an impressive stone shelter at the summit of Cross Fell, the highest point of the Pennines. The hill, once believed to be haunted by demons, was also known as Fiends Fell. According to legend, Saint Augustine banished the evil spirits from Cross Fell and erected a cross and altar on the summit. The cross shaped stone shelter that is now situated there gives protection to walkers from the strong Helm winds associated with this particular peak. Interestingly, the Helm wind is the only named wind in the UK. It is a strong north-easterly wind that blows down the southwest slopes of Cross Fell. It is thought that the shrieking sound of the Helm wind was historically mistaken for the evil demons haunting the hill.\n\nIn my search for vintage paper ephemera relating to the Pennine Way and the area of Cross Fell where Greg�s Hut is situated, I was lucky enough to find vintage maps and literature about the Pennine trail for sale online and in my local antiquarian bookshop. Most of the vintage papers used in this artwork had belonged to a man called Jim Roberts, a keen hiker and cyclist, who sadly passed away earlier this year. These included a first edition copy of a book called The Pennine Way by Kenneth Oldham, published in 1960. Select pages from this book are used within this piece, including the hardback cover that I deconstructed and transformed into a frame for the two miniature paintings.\n\nAs a person who could never make the journey along this remarkable trail myself due to disability, my personal connection is with the South Pennine area around Calderdale and the borderlands of Lancashire where I have lived for over twenty years. We are fortunate to have stunning views of the Pennines from our current home and our last home in Hebden Bridge. In the years when I was bedridden (2009 - 2014) I had views from my bed that I know were essential to my survival. When my life became an endless stretch of stasis, I could watch the seasons change and drink in the incredible beauty of the land as a form of meditation. Often I dreamed about running through the woodland on those steep hills of the Calder Valley. Eventually I recovered enough to get to walk short sections of the trail in our local area. In the panel piece, I have included a section of a vintage map that actually has our last home on it; the 39 Mile mark on the Pennine Way. A small symbol of my love of this place and how it feeds my soul.\n\nThis landscape continues to enchant me. Including the parts my feet will never touch.\n\n\nCREDITS:\n\nI originally started searching for photos with a Creative Commons licence because it wasn�t possible to go to Cross Fell to take my own pictures to inform this artwork. I hit on gold when I discovered a fascinating website https://www.geograph.org.uk/\n\nThe Geograph Project is an open collaborative community project with over 13,000 contributors. The aim of the initiative is to collect geographically representative photographs and information for every square kilometre of Great Britain and Ireland.

I was unable to enter into a lot of childhood play due to my chronic lung condition, and so I took refuge in solitary play. These items on the shelf are external remnants of the inner world which was my shelter, as well as reminders of the shelter of my parents and my childhood home.\n\n\n\nI�m conscious this is quite a selfish reading of the idea of shelter at a time when we are so aware of so many having their homes and their lands destroyed, by human savagery and the effects of climate change.",

The hyper-vigilance that followed really affected me. Any noise outside would spark panic of another break-in. I realised that without safety I didn't feel sheltered.\n\n\n\nThe broken locks, still covered in fingerprint powder were painted in watercolour. I then crushed it to create a new narrative, turning the feelings of fear into something more optimistic and hopeful. This crushed work becomes the still life subject which empowers the transfiguration and resulting abstract oil painting. The abstraction of the original images on the paper transforms the negative feelings that these objects trigger, into a positive association which comes with the practice of painting and making art.

Now rootless, the hair in this work struggles to find a place to anchor itself in the world. Yet the bow � a symbol of innocence and childhood � offers an uncomfortable but grounding reminder that amid the throng of information, possibilities, and selves, play and joy are essential. Childlike expression and revelling in the unusual are vital for thriving.\n\n\n\nThe hair in this work is collected from friends and strangers, representing the love, shelter, and salvation I've found in this disorienting and wonderful world.

They feel comfortable here, because they are doing what they are required to do, and what everybody else expects them to do. When the No. 69 bus they are waiting for arrives, it will take them to Hell via Normalcy. But they are more or less dead anyway, so it doesn't matter. Shelters aren't always good places.

He died a few years ago, the lifestyle caught up with him.Recently I've been gathering my thoughts around people I've known, deciding to make some drawings and such from the photos, a kind of biographical journey, momentos to my life.",

I chose to use my own childhood doll house to be a gateway between my past and present.\n\n\n\nIn the past I would mask my autism to try and be like others. My doll house became my sanctuary where I could safely decompress and allow myself to be me. I filled it with my favourite toys and items I collected.\n\n\n\nMy present self still struggles with the outside world and the doll house shows how I experience the world. The items within are out of scale representing how the smallest things such as smell and noise can be disproportionately overwhelming.\n\n\n\nThe peeling away imagines the process of the masking coming away as I learn how to express my autism and be proud to be different.",

Things like noise, crowds, and smell feel overwhelming and like being swept up in a tornado. I have to keep re arranging and sorting to help me calm down and make sense of the world.\n\nMy dollhouse is still a sanctuary that I use in my art to explore my processing, it still holds my favourite toys, but it also holds my art like the photograms on the wall and it is now a method of showing others the experience of autism.",

The piece is also about the joy that creativity - even post-meal doodling - can bring. I intentionally left the monoprint blank in order to reveal the white paper of the print when depicting the paper in the scene - this emphasises the blankness of paper sheets and it's incredible potential as a technology.

I wanted to convey a feeling of comfort, safety and protection with the woolly nest. It is heavy and smells of sheep, which is a deeply soothing smell. A miniature blanket provides relaxation and warmth to rest. Books are a mainstay of my life and have been instrumental to preserving my mental health in times of trauma, so there is a tiny woolly book in the nest. The minuscule brain represents the main recipient of this healing and recharging time. The tiny blanket, the book and brain are humourous nods to much larger pieces and sensory sculptures I have crocheted with Scottish wool.",

The woman is dressed from an unknown other era, and seems very composed, but is welding a wild animal and hunter, as if this is her natural place in the world.\n\n\n\nVisually, the painting moved away from traditional Tarot towards more implied story telling.

The essence of the project lies in portraying the authenticity of living with a hidden disability and a call for greater understanding.\n\n\n\nThe Scarfs advocate for a society that actively supports the diverse needs of individuals with hidden disabilities. By challenging societal norms that contribute to marginalisation, the scarfs become symbols of social resistance, enabling wearers to reclaim their agency and make visible what is often invisible. Through illuminating the emotional experiences of individuals with hidden disabilities, the scarfs foster conversations on emotions, connection, and dismantling barriers.",

    "Content": "The Dolls House is a collaborative artwork created in response to the theme of \"shelter\" for Outside In's National Open Exhibition 2024. Artists from ArtWorks SY, adults who have a learning disability, are autistic or both, began the project by exploring what \"shelter\" means to them. Through brainstorming and collaging about places, moments, and experiences that evoke safety or escapism, the concept of \"dream rooms\" emerged�spaces filled with elements that individually bring comfort and joy. This idea laid the foundation for The Dolls House.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Dolls House features rooms designed and created by ten artists: David, Gillian, Lisa, Craig, Chris, Corey, Diane, Amy, Asa, and Daniel. Each room reflects a unique theme, ranging from WWE to food, landscapes, birds, football, boy bands, and glitter. The artists crafted miniature furniture and decorative items tied to their themes, incorporating personal touches such as dancing monkeys on beds, painted landscapes, and peacock-feather embellishments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the top floor, a gallery room showcases miniature versions of the artists� works created at ArtWorks, the day care service they attend. This dedicated space celebrates the pride and excitement the artists feel about exhibiting their creations. It includes a diverse range of pieces, from individual projects to large collaborative canvases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the center of the house is a larger room representing ArtWorks itself, where creativity flourishes daily. Surrounded by the individual rooms of the artists, this space reflects the vibrant, supportive environment that inspires them. Encircling the entire house is a colorful autumnal garden, inspired by the views of nature from their South Yorkshire art space and referencing the gardening work many of the artists contribute to within their community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Dolls House encapsulates the unique styles and personalities of the artists. While conceived as a response to the theme of shelter, it has evolved into a celebration of creativity and a meaningful expression of what being artistic means to each contributor.\n\n\n\nYou can watch a video tour of The Dolls House at this YouTube link : https://youtu.be/r75hBFRQt2I?si=WK3jGT8UUXC4dQ9k",

Each of our artist's distinct artistic styles and personalities are on display: from a bedroom with monkeys dancing all around, to a room inspired by a burning love for WWE. Set against the backdrop of the autumnal leaves and trees present at our art space in South Yorkshire, The Dolls House also features a miniature gallery of the artist's original work and a central room inspired by ArtWorks, the day care service that all the artists attend and that brings them together to nurture their own creativity.",

Many of them lost their lives on the way and many managed to reach Europe they headed to from their continents. This jacket was the artefact they held onto as the weaves threatened to swallow them into the depth of the sea and it allowed them to be visible by the passing vessels.

Titled after the 1972 book of essays by Gregory Bateson, the second exhibition highlighted creative and critical engagement with the social crisis of displacement and migration in relation to the environmental crisis. David Cross, the curator wrote: �Displacement and Migration are rather abstract terms that could describe the movement of water by a boat, or the seasonal flight of birds. Such cool terminology may help to counter the inflammatory rhetoric of the private media, politicians and others who stand to gain from policies that exacerbate the crises.",

Now aged 74, with my health at its worst, I've begun to collate and deepen my collection of life-work. Although my body is 70% medication, I've been protected by the medication, kept alive by it and it's been my 'armour', sheltering me from harm. However, its also been responsible for most of my other conditions - hypertension, diabetes, coeliac disease, arthritis and a stomach that's now risen to my chest cavity squashing my lung (which doesn't work at the best of times). This work illustrates my conditions. The heart is at the centre of this work, because it the heart is full of lovely heroes who have emotionally protected and sheltered me, influenced and brought me joy.",

    "Content": "The Shelter I Have Lost reflects the profound pain and emotional devastation caused by the war in Ukraine. This piece is a deeply personal response to the trauma of witnessing destruction, displacement, and loss. Through it, I sought to convey not only the external chaos of war but also its internal toll�how it has left me feeling hollow, as if life itself has drained away.\n\n\n\nThe figure at the center, lifeless and battered, represents the death of innocence and the sense of being torn apart from within. Her golden hair, resembling a blazing sun, is contrasted by the cold, barren branches surrounding her�a stark reminder of the fragility of life amidst ruin. The red, dripping wounds that stretch across her body symbolize both the physical and emotional scars inflicted by war. At her core, a once-vibrant shelter�trees, home, and safety�bleeds away, embodying the loss of stability and warmth. The home is incomplete, its structure disintegrating, just as my sense of belonging and safety has been stripped away.\n\n\n\nThe process of creating this piece was as much about catharsis as it was about expression. I used rough crosshatching and raw, jagged lines to reflect the chaos and destruction that war imposes. The fiery hues of yellow and red clash with the cold, muted tones of blue and black, underscoring the violence of conflict and its chilling aftermath.\n\n\n\nThis artwork captures the emotional void left by war�how it transforms vibrant life into a barren shell. It speaks to the universal yearning for shelter, not just as a physical space, but as a sanctuary for the heart and soul, now tragically lost.",

The home and trees within her chest, now bleeding and fragmented, represent the destruction of what once provided warmth and protection. Surrounding her are barren branches and cold hues, emphasizing the emptiness left in the wake of devastation.\n\n\n\nThrough this piece, I wanted to capture the profound pain of losing not just a home but a sense of identity and comfort.

    "Content": "Baba Yaga (2024), cut and pasted paper on paper, acrylic gold ink.\n\n\n\nThe Baba Yaga is an enigmatic figure of Slavic folklore, often depicted as a wicked crone with a penchant for eating children, however more recent interpretations paint her in a more feminist light, a representation of the complexities of nature, nurture and womanhood.\n\n\n\nThis collage is a more nuanced study of Baba Yaga's legendary home (a hut on bird legs that wanders as it, and its owner, pleases). Created during an Outside In \"Make Art: Online\" workshop, it is a reflection of personal ongoing physical, psychological and emotional journeys that have been, are and will be.\n\n\n\nImage Description: A black and white tavern with brightly coloured windows walks on grey bird legs across a landscape of light green grass and beautiful blue, cloudy skies. A small person with a guitar case hovers, turned as if to enter the tavern's door. There are bushes either side of the tavern by the long grass, and a black and white wild cat, akin to an ocelot, ambles alongside on the left of the piece.

She is enigmatic: a mischievous mediator of life and death, a fierce guardian of nature, more reactive than passive in her actions, unapologetically crossing traditional social confines of femininity in folklore. Her home � a humble abode perched atop bird legs � is both an outward reflection of her unconventionality and an inward personal haven, a safe shelter. My artwork is a depiction of this home and the connection I feel with the feminist interpretation of Baba Yaga�s folklore: she is a woman who has found her path and is unafraid to walk it. This home is me � I am a walking shelter, everything I have been and am contained within, a power to harness, to inform my future and develop my growth as a woman deserving of autonomy, agency and independence.",

There are smaller egg-like forms inside this slender and fragile form, sheltered by the horizontal bands of willow and brown paper. The mother form is precarious, and the eggs are too. This mother is doing her best to shelter the potential children inside of her. She is based on my mother but she is also me, and my grandmother and all the mothers before us.\n\nWhen I was pregnant with my own second child, we were made homeless for a short while but thirty years later I still worry that I cannot keep my children safe out in the world.",
